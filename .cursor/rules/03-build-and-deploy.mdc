# Build and Deployment Guide

## Build Process
The build process is managed by Vite and configured in [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts). The process:

1. TypeScript compilation using the project's tsconfig files
2. Vite bundling and optimization
3. Output generation in the `dist/` directory

## Build Configuration
- Development builds include source maps and hot module replacement
- Production builds are optimized for performance
- Static assets in `public/` are copied as-is to the build output
- Assets in `src/assets/` are processed and optimized

## Deployment Considerations
- The project generates static files that can be served from any web server
- All routes should be configured to fall back to `index.html` for SPA support
- Environment variables should be properly configured for the target environment

## Performance
- The build process includes automatic code splitting
- React components are automatically optimized
- Static assets are processed and optimized during build
